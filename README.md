**Letâ€™s have fun with R!** In this word puzzle game, you are required to
find out the letters in a word within a limited number of guesses. In
each round, if your guess hit any letters in the word, they reveal
themselves. If all letters are revealed before your guesses run out, you
win this game; otherwise you fail. You may run multiple games to guess
different words.
